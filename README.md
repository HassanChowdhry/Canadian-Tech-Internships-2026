## 🎯 Purpose

Most internship lists focus heavily on U.S.-based roles, making it difficult for Canadian students to find relevant, verified opportunities. This repo solves that.

Inspired by:
- [SimplifyJobs/Summer2026-Internships](https://github.com/SimplifyJobs/Summer2026-Internships)
- [vanshb03/Summer2026-Internships](https://github.com/vanshb03/Summer2026-Internships)

…but this list is focused **exclusively on Canadian internships** for easier and faster access.
